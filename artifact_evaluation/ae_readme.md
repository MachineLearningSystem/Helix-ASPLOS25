# Artifact Evaluation for Helix - Reproducibility

We assume that the environment has already been set up based on the `readme.md` in the
root directory of the repository. You can use the host machine in the cluster to run
simulator experiments. You will need the whole cluster of 24 machines to run the
experiments for the prototype system. Before starting artifact evaluation for
reproducibility, run the following command to activate the conda environment:

```bash
conda activate runtime
```

> **Note:** we provide a copy of the result files we get after running the commands.

## Section 6.3 Single Cluster

All files related to this group of experiments are located in `artifact_evaluation/single_cluster`.
Start from the root directory of the repository:
```bash
cd artifact_evaluation/single_cluster
```

### Step 1: Generate Cluster Config Files
Run the following command to generate cluster config files:
```bash
python step1_gen_cluster.py
```
It will automatically generate the config file that represents a cluster with 24 machines 
(4 1xA100 machines, 8 1xL4 machines, 12 1xT4 machines) in `config/cluster24.ini`. It will
also generate the three sub-cluster config files with each type of machine: `config/a100.ini`,
`config/l4.ini` and `config/t4.ini`.

### Model Placement

The next step is to generate the model placement for the cluster. Run the following commands
to generate model placements for LLaMA-1 30B and LLaMA-2 70B using different model placement
methods:

```bash
# Generate model placement using heuristic method Petals
python step2_gen_layout.py petals llama30b
python step2_gen_layout.py petals llama70b
# Generate model placement using heuristic method Swarm
python step2_gen_layout.py swarm llama30b
python step2_gen_layout.py swarm llama70b
# Generate model placement using heuristic method separate pipelines
python step2_gen_layout.py separate llama30b
python step2_gen_layout.py separate llama70b
# Generate model placement using Helix's MILP-based method
python step2_gen_layout.py ilp llama30b
python step2_gen_layout.py ilp llama70b
```
